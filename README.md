# ⚠️ Repository Status: Archived

This repository has been archived and is no longer actively maintained. The project was originally a rewrite of u/clipsync, a Reddit bot for synchronizing Twitch clips on r/LivestreamFail that allowed users to get multiple perspectives of a clip by commenting "!clipsync" with usernames. Development has ceased due to Reddit API changes and evolving Twitch GQL requirements. The code in this rewrite is not very good and could definitely be improved or done more concisely. The code remains available as open-source if anyone wishes to fork or reference it.

# clipsync [![Tests](https://github.com/544146/clipsync/actions/workflows/python-app.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/544146/clipsync/actions/workflows/python-app.yml)

Reddit bot for synchronizing twitch clips with twitch streams, interfaces with reddit via [praw](https://github.com/praw-dev/praw) and twitch via [gql](https://gql.twitch.tv/gql).

Open to feedback, however I rarely work on this project so [pull requests](https://github.com/thomasasfk/clipsync/pulls) are preferred over suggestions please.
